# ChessJS

A simple Chess engine written in TypeScript. So, it probably should be called ChessTS.

Based on the guide: [Programming a JavaScript Chess Engine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbe4gz2gh9BCI6VDA-xafLog) However, I'm doing it in TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

This project is mainly just to practice using some algorithms and concepts.

**Things I've used in this project:**

- [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [Alpha-Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) and [Quiescence search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiescence_search)
- [Game tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_tree)
- [Iterative deepening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search) [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Bitwise operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation)
